# Decisions

## 2026-09-25 — 1. Provisional use of Sonnet 5, with a Day 5 comparison

**What I chose**
Use Sonnet 5 as the initial model for the Day 1 experiment and first extraction implementation. Keep the exact model ID in configuration rather than scattering it through the code.

**What I rejected**
- Comparing several models before the pipeline exists
- Automatically choosing the cheapest model
- Automatically choosing the most powerful and expensive model
- Treating the Day 1 selection as permanent

**Why**
The first objective is to establish a working baseline with one capable model. Comparing models before I have a schema, labelled examples and an evaluation harness would produce impressions rather than evidence.

Using one model also reduces the number of variables while I learn how API requests, responses, tokens and structured outputs work. If something fails, I have fewer possible causes to investigate.

The model decision remains provisional because extraction quality, cost and latency cannot be judged from one prompt. On Day 5, I will run candidate models against the same labelled development examples and compare:
- Commitment recall
- Precision
- Language-strength accuracy
- Quote validity
- Schema compliance
- Cost
- Latency

The sealed Coral Pay deal will not be used for model selection.

**Revisit when**
Day 5, once the development corpus, labels and evaluation harness exist.

## 2026-09-25 — 2. Three separate commitment attributes instead of one ladder

**What I chose**
Represent each commitment using three independent attributes:
1. Language strength — exploratory, conditional or firm
2. Contractual presence — absent or included in the draft contract
3. Authorisation evidence — standard-authorised, exception-approved, no approval evidence, or unknown/needs review

**What I rejected**
One ladder such as: exploratory → proposed → approved → contractually binding

**Why**
The original ladder combined three different questions:
- How confidently was the promise expressed?
- Did the company authorise it?
- Did it enter the contract?

Those questions do not always move together. For example:
- A salesperson can make a firm verbal promise with no approval evidence.
- A standard capability can be authorised, even though it was only discussed tentatively.
- A commitment can appear in a draft contract despite having no internal approval.
- A proposal can repeat a firm commitment without making it contractually binding.

A single ladder would force these situations into misleading categories and hide the conflicts the product is supposed to find.

The three-attribute model allows the system to identify precise risks, such as:
- Firm language with no approval evidence
- Draft-contract inclusion with no approval evidence
- A conditional promise becoming firm
- A catalogue-supported capability being described outside its approved limits

Because the build is pre-signature, "contractually binding" is not used. The system records only whether the commitment is present in the draft contract.

**Revisit when**
After Day 3 labelling, if the categories repeatedly overlap or cannot be applied consistently.

## 2026-09-25 — 3. Authorisation must come from authoritative evidence

**What I chose**
Assign authorisation evidence only by checking the commitment against designated authoritative sources:
- The capability catalogue establishes what may be sold as standard, including limits, regions and approval requirements.
- The pricing and services note records explicit exceptions, together with the approved terms, approver and date.
- If the commitment matches a capability but its specific terms are not authorised, label it no approval evidence.
- If it cannot be confidently matched to a catalogue capability, label it unknown/needs review.

**What I rejected**
- Inferring approval from confident language
- Assuming something is approved because it appears in a proposal or SOW
- Assuming a draft-contract clause must have received internal approval
- Asking the extraction model to decide whether a commitment was authorised

**Why**
A customer-facing document proves what was offered; it does not prove that the company approved the offer internally. Using the proposal or contract to infer approval would create circular reasoning: the system would treat the potentially problematic commitment as evidence that it was authorised.

The separation also makes the result auditable. Every authorisation verdict must point to either:
- A catalogue entry authorising the commitment on those terms, or
- An explicit exception in the pricing and services note

If neither exists, the system escalates rather than guesses.

This decision creates one of the product's most valuable findings: "This commitment appears in the draft contract, but no internal authorisation evidence was found."

Authorisation therefore belongs in conflict verification, after extraction and consolidation — not in extraction itself.

**Revisit when**
If the product later connects to a formal deal-desk or approval system that becomes an additional authoritative source.

## 2026-09-25 — 4. Label authorisation once per consolidated commitment, including clean examples

**What I chose**
Label language strength for each individual source statement. After equivalent statements have been consolidated, label authorisation evidence once for each materially distinct set of commitment terms.

Include both:
- Planted conflicts
- Clean, correctly authorised commitments

**What I rejected**
- Labelling authorisation separately for every repeated quote
- Labelling only the six known conflicts
- Treating every mention of the same capability as having identical terms

**Why**
Authorisation applies to the actual terms of a commitment, not merely to the name of the capability.

For example, these may refer to the same connector but require different authorisation decisions:
- "The connector is generally available in Singapore."
- "The connector will support five million transactions per day."
- "The connector will be delivered by 31 October at no additional cost."

If identical terms appear in a call, proposal and SOW, they should become one consolidated commitment with several sources and one authorisation label. Labelling every occurrence would duplicate work and could introduce inconsistent ground truth.

If the terms materially change — such as a new deadline, volume, region, price or service obligation — the changed version requires its own authorisation assessment.

Clean examples are essential because evaluation must measure both:
- Whether the system catches real conflicts
- Whether it incorrectly flags valid commitments

Labelling only planted conflicts would allow measurement of recall, but not precision or false-positive behaviour.

**Revisit when**
If the corpus becomes much larger and some deterministic labels can be generated automatically and then human-verified.

## 2026-09-25 — 5. Typed close-of-day quiz instead of voice memos

Replaced voice memos with a typed close-of-day quiz; will practise spoken answers before Checkpoint 2.

## 2026-09-26 — 6. Detect expectation gaps across the complete deal record

**What I chose**
Detect unresolved specific commitments across the complete deal record, not only unauthorised commitments in the contract. Flag any firm, testable customer-facing commitment whose material terms are not matched or incorporated by reference in the draft contract, SOW or priced services, and for which no later document explicitly supersedes, excludes or withdraws that commitment. Testable means it contains a quantity, date, volume, geography, named capability or integration, defined scope, service effort or responsibility.

**What I rejected**
Flagging every earlier firm statement absent from the contract, because generic RFP answers would create excessive noise.

**Why**
A gap is raised only when material terms are unmatched and there is no explicit later disposition. The end states (incorporated, accepted with an owner, or explicitly changed and clarified with the customer) belong on the decision screen, not in extraction, and need no sixth action. Consolidation accuracy becomes a critical dependency: an uncertain link is shown as needs review, never asserted as a confirmed gap. One Harbour Bank conflict is replaced by an expectation-gap scenario, keeping the total at six.

This is the final conceptual change. New ideas go on the Later list.
